Mandatory Project 4
--------------------

This project deals with the implementation of PERT charts. EC has been computed using topological ordering algo 1 and LC has been computed using topological ordering algo 2.

It contains 6 files in total :

1. Timer.java
----------------
This JAVA file contains the various factors which display out the Timing and Memory capcaity.

2. Vertex.java
----------------
This JAVA file is the vertex representing the various requirements of an vertex in Graph.

3. Edge.java
----------------
This JAVA file is the edge representing the various requirements of an edge in Graph.

4. Graph.java
-------------
This file consists of various techniques and methods which can be used to read the input Graph.

5. CriticalPath.java
----------------------
This file contains :

 void findCriticalPaths(Graph g) // which displays the length of critical paths, critical path itself ,header of table, number of critical nodes

6. Driver.java
---------------
This file is the main driver of the program which prints the Critical Path's Details, Distance alongwith Timer and Memory.
